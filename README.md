## Features & Usage

### 1. autosave.js

Automatically saves states localStorage.

### 5. codeblock.js

Drop the heavy Prism setup. Just include the codeblock.js script in your template and it handles everything. You only need to paste the script once. After that, it detects the file extension and applies syntax highlighting automatically. No extra Prism scripts required. It works with most Prism-supported languages out of the box and defaults to a dark theme. If you want a light theme, just override the styles using !important. No need for manual <pre> tags or extra configuration.

Usage Example:

```html
<code lang="py">your python code</code>
```

```html
<code lang="js">your javascript code</code>
```

> __Warning:__ This only supports adding code blocks in HTML. Directly injecting text into code blocks via JavaScript requires manipulating the .code-content query selector. You also need to use :not() to include unsupported languages.

Install via -

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vkdatta/web@main/app/dexsins/dexsinsjs/codeblock.js"></script>
```

### 6. preprocessor.js 

preprocessor.js is extremely useful when working with large HTML files that become difficult to maintain and scale. By splitting sections of HTML into different HTML files or creating a file for repeated UI sections into smaller reusable chunks, you avoid duplication and keep your main files clean and readable. Instead of editing the same structure in multiple places, you update it once and reuse it everywhere. The data-* binding mechanism allows small variations (like titles, descriptions, or buttons) without breaking the shared structure. This makes development faster, reduces errors, and creates a modular system similar to components in modern frameworks without needing any build tools or libraries.
